I worked on a C# Unity project called Space Pizza, while in Denmark!

Basically you fly around a space pizza ship -- but instead of using WASD you use your mouse. Your mouse acts like an attractor when clicked attracting your ship towards it. So go visit the game and feed the aliens before they go hungry!

Here's a link to it: [Space Pizza](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~garciagr17/space-pizza/)
